In this project I have developed a program focused on an online store, in which an account and a password are necessary to verify authentication.
It has been declared in 6 class that are:

class Category, 
class List_category, 
class List_product, 
class Menu, 
class Product, 
class User.


In the main menu it is necessary to access the store with username and password.
To exit the main menu, type "exit" in the username and password.

Main menu:

1. Enter an username
2. Enter a password


After authentication, the secondary menu will be displayed

1. See all products
2. See all categories
3. Search a product
4. Search by category
5. Buy
6. Your products
0. exit

I have created a general list for category and for produc.


In option 1. You can see all available products. 
I maked a list of products general and inside a maked list_product. 
I go through a list with "search_product function"

In option 2. You can see all available categories.
The "search_product function" does the same as the "search_category function", is structured in the same way.
It has a general list and each category has a list.
