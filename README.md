In this project I have developed a program focused on an online store, in which an account and a password are necessary to verify authentication.
It has been declared in 6 class that are:

class Category, 
class List_category, 
class List_product, 
class Menu, 
class Product, 
class User, 

Main menu:

1. Enter an username
2. Enter a password


After authentication, the secondary menu will be displayed

1. See all products
2. See all categories
3. Search a product
4. Search by category
5. Buy
6. Your products
0. exit
